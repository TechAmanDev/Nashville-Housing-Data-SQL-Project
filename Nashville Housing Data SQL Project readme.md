This project demonstrates SQL skills using Nashville Housing Data from Kaggle. The dataset is analyzed and cleaned using MySQL Workbench, showcasing various SQL techniques and data manipulation skills.

# Key Features:

1. Data Cleaning: Standardizing date formats and handling NULL values.
2. Address Parsing: Splitting property and owner addresses into separate columns.
3. Data Transformation: Converting 'Y' and 'N' to 'Yes' and 'No' in the SoldAsVacant field.
4. Removing Duplicates: Using ROW_NUMBER() to identify and remove duplicate entries.
5. Column Management: Dropping unused columns to optimize the dataset.

This project demonstrates proficiency in SQL operations such as UPDATE, JOIN, CASE statements, string manipulations, and temporary table creation. It serves as a practical example of data cleaning and preparation techniques using SQL.
